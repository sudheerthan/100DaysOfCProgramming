1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code file (`OddOrEven.c`).
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (`gcc OddOrEven.c -o OddOrEven`).
4. Run the compiled executable (`./OddOrEven`).
5. The program will prompt you to enter a number.
6. The program will determine if the entered number is even or odd.
7. The result will be displayed on the screen.
