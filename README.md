## Introduction

Hello! I'm sudheerthan, and I'm embarking on a 100-day journey to master C programming. This repository serves as a log of my daily progress, challenges, and achievements. Feel free to join me on this exciting coding adventure!

## Getting Started

If you're new here, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
     git clone https://github.com/sudheerthan/100DaysOfCProgramming.git

2. **Setup Your Development Environment:**
   - Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC) on your machine.
   - Set up an integrated development environment (IDE) or use a text editor of your choice.

3. **Explore the Challenges:**
   - Check the [Day-wise Progress](#day-wise-progress) section to see the list of challenges for each day.
   - Start with Day 1 and proceed at your own pace.

### Day 2: Sum of two numbers.
- Create a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum.

### Day 3: Check if a number is even or odd.
- Write a program to determine whether a given number is even or odd.

... (continue with Days 4-10)

## Arrays and Strings

### Day 11: Array manipulation (insert, delete, update).
- Implement basic operations on an array: insert, delete, and update elements.

### Day 12: Find the largest element in an array.
- Write a program to find and print the largest element in an array.

... (continue with Days 13-30)

## Pointers and Memory Allocation

### Day 31: Swap two numbers using pointers.
- Implement a program that swaps the values of two numbers using pointers.

### Day 32: Reverse an array using pointers.
- Create a program to reverse the elements of an array using pointers.

... (continue with Days 33-50)

## Data Structures

### Day 51: Binary search tree implementation.
- Implement a basic binary search tree with insertion and search functions.

### Day 52: Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Write functions for in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal of a binary tree.

... (continue with Days 53-70)

## Algorithms and Problem Solving

### Day 71: Implement binary search.
- Develop a binary search algorithm for a sorted array.

### Day 72: Merge sort implementation.
- Write a program that performs sorting using the merge sort algorithm.

... (continue with Days 73-90)

## Advanced Topics and Optimization

### Day 91: Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) implementation.
- Implement a Binary Indexed Tree for efficient range queries.

### Day 92: Trie-based search engine.
- Create a simple search engine using a trie data structure.

... (continue with Days 93-100)

## Projects
